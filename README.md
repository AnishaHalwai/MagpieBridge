MagpieBridge in Chinese: in a Chinese legend, a human and a fairy fall in love, but this love angers the gods, who separate them
on opposite sides of the Milky Way. However, on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month each year,
thousands of magpies form a bridge, called 鹊桥 in Chinese and Queqiao in pinyin, allowing the lovers
to meet.
